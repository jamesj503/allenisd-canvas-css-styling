A better look for canvas using a CSS style sheeting.

I am a student inside Allen ISD. I have a lot of free time since it is COVID year.

I hate the look of canvas, so I made everything more simple on this site...

Style 1: Muli

New version (Alpha: Update 4) is available here: https://github.com/jamesj503/allenisd-canvas-css-styling/blob/main/Muli.v4

Everthing is in lower case just because I like it more that way!

Colors are faded on the teachers pictures

Teachers home pages aren't as ugly

The missing label had an update

^original update, still available within the first release.
If you want it (https://github.com/jamesj503/allenisd-canvas-css-styling/blob/main/Ver1-aesthetic)

^new release, how it looks full screen on PC mode

Style 2: ALL-BOLD

Everything is CAPS LOCK.

Only the dashboard for now. I will be doing teachers pages in the next update.

Not as **good** as the aesthetic style, but still took me a while to do.

Style 3: grayspace

This is the cleanest one yet. I even photoshoped the logo to be gray!

Nothing really to say about this one... its all grayscale!!!

How to use:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld

Go to that link and download the CSS runner. And don't worry, even those school-appointed Chromebooks can use this without exploding.

Press add new.

Press on the right-hand side text box. 

Download the new release. (either one of the .txt files)

https://github.com/jamesj503/allenisd-canvas-css-styling/releases/tag/v1.24

Open it up. It will open up in your default text editor.

Open up the file in a text editor and copy the WHOLE thing.

Paste this into the right-hand side of the editor in the extension (see image below)

Make sure the URL is set to https://canvas.allenisd.org/
