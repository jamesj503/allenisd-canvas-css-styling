A better look for canvas using a CSS style sheeting.

I am a student inside Allen ISD. I have a lot of free time since it is COVID year.

I hate the look of canvas, so I made everything more simple on this site...

Style 1: AESTHETIC (kinda)
Everthing is in lower case just because I like it more that way!
Colors are faded
Teachers home pages aren't as ugly
The "missing" label is no longer in bold

How to use:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld
Go to that link and download the CSS runner. 
Press add new.
Press on the right-hand side text box. 
Copy the CSS sheet from my Github push called css-sheet
Paste this whoe sheet into the right-hand side of the editor and press save.
Make sure the URL is set to https://canvas.allenisd.org/
