A better look for canvas using a CSS style sheeting.

I am a student inside Allen ISD. I have a lot of free time since it is COVID year.

I hate the look of canvas, so I made everything more simple on this site...

Style 1: AESTHETIC (kinda)

Everthing is in lower case just because I like it more that way!

Colors are faded on the teachers pictures

Teachers home pages aren't as ugly

The "missing" label is no longer visible! (but the red dot next to them is just so you can still tell!)

How to use:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld
Go to that link and download the CSS runner. And don't worry, even those school-appointed Chromebooks can use this without exploding.

Press add new.

Press on the right-hand side text box. 

Download the new release (where is says .zip source code, not the .targz) https://github.com/jamesj503/allenisd-canvas-css-styling/releases

Extract the file and open up the CSS sheet you want. Ignore the read.md, .gitignore, and the license file.

Open up the file in a text editor and copy the WHOLE thing.

Paste this into the right-hand side of the editor in the extension (see image below)

Make sure the URL is set to https://canvas.allenisd.org/
